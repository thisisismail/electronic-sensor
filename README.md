The heat generated by a laptop is a natural consequence of power dissipation by its components due to electrical energy usage. Excessive heat can affect the laptop's performance. One way to mitigate high temperatures is by using a Cooling Pad, which blows air at the bottom of the laptop to expel the heat. The airflow is produced by a fan, which generates more airflow when it spins faster. A Cooling Pad with a constant fan speed can be inefficient, as the speed might be too slow for high temperatures or too fast for low temperatures. A Smart Cooling Pad, with adjustable fan speed according to the temperature, can address this inefficiency. The fan remains off when the temperature is normal, starts spinning as the temperature rises, and continues to speed up as the laptop gets hotter.
